# DQN-CartPole
DQN reinforcement learning agent for CartPole-v1

This is a reinforcement learning agent (specifically DQN) for Atari-2000 benchmark based on deep learning neural networks written in Python using Pytorch.

Structure:
Network: Dense
Loss: smooth_l1_loss

1). Install packages from 'requirements.txt' in your environment.
3). src directory should contain directories: 'Atari_saved'.
4). No dataset needed.
5). Run training via 'cartpole.py' or 'cartpole_frameskip.py' for frameskipping.
